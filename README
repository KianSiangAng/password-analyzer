Password Analyzer

A Python terminal application that analyzes the strength and security of passwords. It evaluates length, complexity, entropy, risk score, and checks if the password is commonly used or has appeared in known breaches via the Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) API.

The project features:
	•	Length, complexity, and entropy checks
	•	Common password detection from common_passwords.txt
	•	HIBP breach database integration
	•	Intuitive risk scoring system (0 = low risk, 100 = high risk)
	•	Color-coded terminal output using colorama
	•	Nicely formatted summary table using tabulate
	•	Suggestions for improving weak passwords

Installation and Setup

Option 1: One-command setup (recommended)

From your project folder, run:

python setup.py

This will:
	1.	Install all required Python packages (colorama, requests, tabulate).
	2.	Ensure common_passwords.txt is present for common password detection.

After setup, you are ready to run the analyzer.

⸻

Option 2: Manual setup
	1.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
	2.	Make sure common_passwords.txt exists in your project folder.

Usage

Run the analyzer:

python analyzer.py

Enter your password (input is hidden) when prompted. The program will display:
	•	Password summary table (Length, Complexity, Entropy, Breaches, Risk Score)
	•	Detailed analysis (rating, breach info, suggestions)

Example Output

Enter password to analyze (input hidden): ********

Rating: Moderate
Password not found in known breaches

Suggestions:
• Add uppercase letters
• Mix letters, numbers, and special characters for stronger password

Risk Score Explanation
	•	0–30: Low risk (green) – strong password
	•	31–70: Moderate risk (yellow) – acceptable password
	•	71–100: High risk (red) – weak or breached password

⸻

Dependencies
	•	Python 3.9+
	•	colorama – for colored terminal output
	•	requests – for HIBP API requests
	•	tabulate – for formatted tables
